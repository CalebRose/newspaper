Earlier this\r\n              week, Golic senator Maurice Dechaunne signed a groundbreaking deal\r\n              with Taur Zola, the governor of Sabelle, to permit the New Gol\r\n              Republic to moderate and run mining operations in the region. The\r\n              New Gol Republic will ship equipment for Akhoran mining companies\r\n              for use within quarries, with the intention of Golic supervisors\r\n              overseeing operations and use of said equipment.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The North Akhoran regions have been reknowned for it's rich\r\n              minerals and quality of materials. Through this deal, the New Gol\r\n              Republic seeks to revolutionize it's production and keep up with\r\n              neighboring nations in what is an industrial race of power.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The trade deal is also a sign for peace in the region between the\r\n              Republic and region. For years in the third era, the region\r\n              remained under turmoil from imperialist conflict between the New\r\n              Gol Republic, the Triptych Church, and the Walderlund. The\r\n              conflict came to a close during the twilight years of the Third\r\n              Era when the Triptych Church regressed and the Waldish drove the\r\n              Golic transplants from Sabelle and neighboring coastal towns. When\r\n              the Walderlund had Golic leader Denault sign the peace agreement\r\n              between the two nations, it was implied that the Walderlund would\r\n              return the North Akhoran territories under Golic rule, under the\r\n              condition that the territory remain autonomous.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Waldish congressmen have pointed to the trade deal as infringment\r\n              and violation of the peace agreed between the Waldish and the\r\n              Golic. Golic representatives have stated the trade agreement\r\n              between Maurice Dechaunne and Taur Zola does not infringe on the\r\n              peace treaty signed well ago. Akhoran towns such as Sabelle will\r\n              retain autonomy on all mining operations, and will act independent\r\n              in the appointment of Golic supervisors. By providing\r\n              state-of-the-art Golic equipment, the new Gol hopes to reinvest in\r\n              the region and in its natural resources.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p></p>\r\n            <figure className='figure'>\r\n              <img\r\n                className='media'\r\n                src='https://www.art-prints-on-demand.com/kunst/_frenchphotographer/ansicht-der-pariser-oper-ende-des-19-jahrhunderts.jpg'\r\n              />\r\n              <figcaption class='figcaption'>\r\n                \"Vernir, Capital of the New Gol Republic.\"\r\n              </figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class='collumn hero'>\r\n            <div class='body-header'>FULL STEAM AHEAD!</div>\r\n            <img src='https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/47/154297-large.jpg' />\r\n            <div class='small-collumn tile'>\r\n              <div class='head'>\r\n                <span class='headline hl1'>Latest Train from Vanderfeight</span>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  <span class='headline hl2'>by Viktor Ahrenwall</span>\r\n                </p>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Erwin Vanderfeight of Freightreight Industries has followed on\r\n                his promise to provide more commercial options in the\r\n                Walderlund, Rubinia, and Halvania.

Yet the\r\n              streets of Derdach remain active through the night. The shops may\r\n              close and offices may shut, but life thrives on the streets.\r\n              Nothing out of the ordinary, and nothing of fanfare. What remains\r\n              different about these nightly scenes are our eyes to the\r\n              spectacle! Light that shines that reflecting upon the sun! It is\r\n              not the lantern of yesteryear, no. Rather, grand inventions from\r\n              the Halvanian mind, Meister Turen Funke: a lightbulb.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Funke, a former blacksmith, took up his tongs and placed it upon\r\n              himself to light his own quarters without the need of candle.\r\n              After numerous contraptions contracting and consecuentually\r\n              crumbling the formerly proclaimed mad scientist harnessed light\r\n              fueled by incandescense, copper, and tungsten within its glassed\r\n              contraption (Try blurting that out with your tongue)! Mad Funke\r\n              was, upon a flicker he became anything but! A man who has\r\n              rightfully earned the last laugh! And now his lightbulb,\r\n              previously seen at the World's Fair in Gardenia, now illuminate\r\n              Derdach's darkest nights, the very streets of the Waldish capital!\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Turen Funke is currently funded by the Gardenian Republic of\r\n              Halvania; but has followed through on a promise to the Halvanian\r\n              king to light all Halvanian cities by the end of the year. The\r\n              installation of these new lampposts in Derdach ensures that Funke\r\n              holds greater ambitions: not only enlighten Halvania, to bring his\r\n              Waldish brothers alongside him into the 4th era, and perhaps all\r\n              of Reges as well. How magnificent it is, for our capital to follow\r\n              one of Halvania's brightest minds into a golden era of innovation.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          {/* <div class='collumn'>\r\n          <div class='head'>\r\n            <span class='headline hl1'>May the Force be with you</span>\r\n            <p>\r\n              <span class='headline hl2'>\r\n                Let go your conscious self and act on instinct\r\n              </span>\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
